Description:
Pal-ate game-ifies the way people interact with food! Compete with your friends and collect all of your new cuddly companions! Learn about different foods’ culture, recipes, and local restaurants to buy from—all with a single photo! 

It’s simple, really. Take a picture, upload it, and learn all the information about it. Try new cuisines and obtain new Pals! See how your friends compare through a real-time leaderboard!

Pal-ate, breaking down barriers one bite at a time.
